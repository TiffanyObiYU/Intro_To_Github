# Intro To Github

## What is Github?

GitHub is a cloud-based service and website that allows users to create, store, and collaborate on code. 

## How will our students use Github?

GitHub is often used to host open source software development projects and is the world's largest coding community. Most projects are team based, which means that students have to make the code they have on their personal devices available to every team member's personal devices as well. In order to do this students will be pushing or 'uploading' their projects to the 'cloud'. Once it's in the cloud, Github is the website/service we are using to see what the students are working on and the tool they will be using to peice together their individual projects into one big project. 

- Update: Students are doing personal projects this cycle but will still have to use Github to store or save their projects as they start, build and complete them.


## Things to know:

### What is Forking? 

Forking creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository. 

### What is cloning? 

Cloning makes a local copy of a repository, not your own copy.
